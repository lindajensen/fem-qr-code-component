## Overview

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
I finally learned how to center a div. Well I kind of knew it before, but I can never seem to remember it. But this time I remembered almost all of it. Except setting the height to 100vh so that frustrated me for a bit.

I also learned how to use CSS Custom Properties. It just seemed like the easiest way to deal with the colors when they were in hsl. I also tried writing syntax in a markdown-file. I've never done that before so that was interesting. I was so pretty and structured.

### Code snippets

```css
:root {
    --white: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
    --lightgray: hsl(212, 45%, 89%);
    --grayblue: hsl(220, 15%, 55%);
    --darkblue: hsl(218, 44%, 22%);
}
```

### Continued development

I need to continue working with and practicing Flexbox. I couldn't quite figure out how to get the padding just right and so that's also something to keep practicing. I also need to learn more about media queries. I decided to just leave it in this project. I need to read up on and practice the mobile first approach.

### Useful resources

- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) - This helped me figure out the syntax for a markdown file.
- [CSS Custom Properties](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Using_CSS_custom_properties) - This iwas great help when it came to creating my CSS Custom Properties.
